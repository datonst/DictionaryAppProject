# Major Assignment: English-Vietnamese Dictionary

Welcome to our major assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class (INT2204 - 25) at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET). In this project, we have developed an English-Vietnamese dictionary application using Java programming language, with various features to enhance language learning and exploration.

## Project Overview

This dictionary application is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in learning and exploring the English and Vietnamese languages. It was created by students enrolled in the OOP class at UET as a part of their major assignment.

## Features

### 1. Dictionary Functionality
- **Search:** Users can search for Englishe words to get their corresponding translations and meanings.
